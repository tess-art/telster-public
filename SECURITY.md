## 🚨 Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security issue or vulnerability, **please do not open a public issue or pull request**.  
Instead, report it privately via our dedicated channel:

📩 **security@telsterinc.com**

Include the following details:
- A clear description of the issue and where it occurs  
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability  
- Potential impact and suggested mitigation (if known)  
- Your contact information for follow-up communication  

You will receive an acknowledgment within **72 hours**, and we’ll keep you informed of progress as the issue is reviewed and resolved.

## 🔐 Handling Process

1. Report is received and validated.  
2. Telster’s internal security team reproduces the issue.  
3. A fix or mitigation is developed, reviewed, and tested.  
4. A coordinated release and public advisory (if applicable) is published.  
5. The reporter is credited (with consent).

We take all responsible disclosures seriously and appreciate your assistance in keeping the ecosystem secure.

## 🧭 Scope

This policy applies to all public Telster Inc. repositories and open-access SDKs or APIs.  
Internal systems and closed infrastructures are covered by private agreements and are **not within public disclosure scope**.

## ⚖️ Legal & Disclosure Policy

Telster Inc. does **not** pursue legal action against researchers who:
- Follow this responsible disclosure process  
- Avoid data exfiltration or user impact  
- Refrain from public disclosure before coordinated release  

We believe in positive, ethical collaboration between researchers and our team.
